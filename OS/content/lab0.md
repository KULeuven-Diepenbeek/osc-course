## Virtual vs Real

All lab sessions are done using a Linux operating system. Because not everybody is willing to install a linux OS, a virtual machine image is generated. This image contains all the tools that are required for the labs.

However, students that are interested in installing a linux system on their machines are encouraged to do so. A list of todo's will be provided so they can prepare their installs accordingly.

A **Virtual Machine** emulates a computer system. It tries to reproduce the functionality and computing environment of the target machine. 

Software that allows the management of virtual machines is refered to as **Hypervisors**. Examples of hypervisors are: VMware, Xen, Hyper-V, and Virtual Box.

Studying VMs and hypervisors is a course on its own and is not within scope for this course.

The labs are given on a Virtual Box machine which have an installation of Bodhi Linux.
