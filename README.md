## Quicktakes Hugo

* Hugo is configured through config.toml
* a certain foldertree is expected
* running hugo (cmd 'hugo'), generates static web content in "docs"
* running hugo server (cmd 'hugo server') runs a local server (http://localhost:1313) so changes in the Markdown files are automatically updated
