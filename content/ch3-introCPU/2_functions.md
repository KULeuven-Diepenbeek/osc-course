JMPi to SKIP things, but can also be used to re-do things, like we saw with while/for in exercises!

Now, we can also use it to implement functions

However, need to keep track of a return address (no need before, but much needed now)

## Passing parameters to functions

? how does the function know where it can find the parameters? at which addresses they are? 
    Can't just have addresses agreed to up-front, would not be secure / can't dynamically load software

## The Stack


## Recursive functions



## Assembly works on registers, not addresses directly

It gets worse: we don't have infinite memory, just say 32... rest needs to be spilled to memory
sw and lw 

## RAM is slow... have some registers close by 

mention cache
