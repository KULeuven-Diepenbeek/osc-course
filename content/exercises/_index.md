### Part A

# Assignments

This part contains obligatory assignments for students to complete and return to the teaching staff. These will be graded and make up for a portion of the total grading of this course. Every few weeks, new exercises will be made available, so be sure to check out this section now and then.

#### Submitting your exercises

Assignments can be submitted via [Toledo](https://toledo.kuleuven.be/portal/), when _assignments_ are available on the platform. 

**File submission format**: `lastname_firstname_[assignmentnr].zip`. E.g. for assignment 1: groeneveld_wouter_1.zip. _Do not_ submit single uncompressed files, always adhere to the `.zip` extension. 

**Deadlines** are also visible on the assignment page via Toledo. Usually, when instructors announce the exercise that has to be submitted, the deadline will be _within a few weeks_, on a day specified in the lab (and on toledo), at 5 PM (end of business day). Be sure to double check the deadline date at Toledo!
