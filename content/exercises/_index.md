### Part A

# Exercises

This part contains exercises for students to complete and return to the teaching staff. These will be graded and make up for a portion of the total grading of this course. Every few weeks, new exercises will be made available, so be sure to check out this section now and then. 

#### Submitting your exercises

Exercises can be submitted via [Toledo](https://toledo.kuleuven.be/portal/), when _assignments_ are available on the platform. 

**Deadlines** are also visible on the assignment page via Toledo. Usually, when instructors announce the exercise that has to be submitted, the deadline will be in _that same week_, on friday, at 12H PM midnight.
